      <p> Mayor Bill DeBlasio has championed an initiative to create 300,000 affordable housing units by 2026 to tackle homelessness in the city </p>
      <p> Data above shows exceptional growth New York City has made from 2017-2019 toward the 300,000 unit goal </p>
      <p> Developers halted devlepments earlier in the year as the pandemic shuttered businesses accross the board. No new units were produced for months </p>
      <p> New York City Council Member Rafael Samanca, representing the South Bronx, championed legislation aimed at forcing developers recieving city funds to put aside 15 percent of units aside for homeless individuals and families.</p>
      <p> The legislation aims to create 1,000 new units dedicated solely to homeless housing per year. Salamanca presented the legislation in 2018 and it was ultimately passed in 2019 </p>
      <p> But no one has spoken up to say whether or not these goals are being met, or let alone being tracked. Renters seeking to stay afloat also face the issue of finding housing that fits into their income bracket, that some experts say does not
        represent the socioeconomic reality of the Bronx </p>
      <p> "We're not creating units that can be leased and rented by people making $35,000 a year. We need to pay greater attentiion to that lower tier of income earners," said WHEDCo president Davon Russell. Russell oversees several affordable
        housing units in the Bronx. </p>
